## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get FeedbackPro up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) instance (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/feedbackpro.git
    cd feedbackpro
    \`\`\`
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    \`\`\`

### Environment Variables

FeedbackPro relies on several environment variables for its functionality. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and populate it with the following:

\`\`\`env
# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/feedbackpro

# AI/Sentiment Analysis
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Socket.io (Optional, for local development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Vercel Deployment (for production)
VERCEL_URL=https://your-vercel-app-url.vercel.app
\`\`\`

#### How to Get Your Keys:

1.  **`NEXTAUTH_URL`**:
    *   For local development, set this to `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   For production, set this to your deployed Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`).
2.  **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`**:
    *   Generate a strong, random string. You can use `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal or a similar online tool. This is crucial for securing your NextAuth.js sessions.
3.  **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`**:
    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project (if you don't have one).
    *   Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    *   Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
    *   Select "Web application".
    *   Add `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001` (for Socket.io server) as Authorized JavaScript origins.
    *   Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` and `https://your-vercel-app-url.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google` as Authorized redirect URIs.
    *   Your Client ID and Client Secret will be displayed.
4.  **`MONGODB_URI`**:
    *   If using **MongoDB Atlas**: Log in, create a new cluster, and follow their instructions to get the connection string (usually starts with `mongodb+srv://`). Remember to replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your database user credentials.
    *   If using **local MongoDB**: It's typically `mongodb://localhost:27017/feedbackpro`.
5.  **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**:
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Create a new API key.
6.  **`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`**:
    *   These are for sending emails (e.g., feedback notifications, welcome emails).
    *   **For Gmail**:
        *   `SMTP_HOST`: `smtp.gmail.com`
        *   `SMTP_PORT`: `587`
        *   `SMTP_USER`: Your Gmail address (e.g., `your-email@gmail.com`)
        *   `SMTP_PASS`: You'll need to generate an **App Password** for your Google account. Go to your Google Account Security settings, enable 2-Step Verification, then go to App Passwords and generate a new one. **Do NOT use your regular Gmail password.**
    *   For other email providers, consult their documentation for SMTP settings.
7.  **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`**:
    *   For local development, set this to `http://localhost:3001` (assuming your Socket.io server runs on port 3001).
    *   For production, this should be the URL where your Socket.io server is deployed.
8.  **`VERCEL_URL`**:
    *   This variable is automatically set by Vercel during deployment. For local development, you can omit it or set it to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    \`\`\`
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Socket.io server (if you have a separate one):**
    *   *Note: The current setup assumes Socket.io is integrated within the Next.js API routes or a separate simple Node.js server. If you have a dedicated Socket.io server, ensure it's running on `http://localhost:3001` or the port specified in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`.*

## üåê Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  **Connect your GitHub repository** to Vercel.
2.  **Add all environment variables** from your `.env.local` file to your Vercel project settings (under "Environment Variables"). Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`).
3.  Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application.
